'### Spotify Recommendation System'

'A project proposal should include:'

'## Introduction/Background: A quick introduction of your topic and mostly literature review of what has been done in this area.' 
'Finding new music is something that everyone struggles with. We aim to quell the struggle using machine learning to suggest songs similar to user taste, by analyzing existent songs on Spotify according to their features of danceability, energy, and others.'
'By doing this, we will be able to recommend songs to users according to several filters that they select, which will be according to mood, vocals, genre, and others.'
'To accomplish this, we plan on using a dataset containing information about thousands of songs on spotify of various genres, in order to find similar traits amongst certain songs'

'Problem definition: Why there is a problem here or what is the motivation of the project?'

'Methods: What algorithms or methods are you going to use to solve the problems. (Note: Use existing packages/libraries)'

'Potential results and Discussion: Discuss about what type of quantitative metrics your team plan to use for the project (i.e. ML Metrics).'

'At least three references (preferably peer reviewed). You need to properly cite the references on your proposal. This part does NOT count towards word limit.'
'Add proposed timeline from start to finish and list each project members’ responsibilities. Fall and Spring semester sample Gantt Chart. This part does NOT count towards word limit.'
'A contribution table with all group members’ names that explicitly provides the contribution of each member in preparing the project task. This part does NOT count towards word limit.'
'A checkpoint to make sure you are working on a proper machine learning related project. You are required to have your dataset ready when you submit your proposal. You can change dataset later. However, you are required to provide some reasonings why you need to change the dataset (i.e. dataset is not large enough because it does not provide us a good accuracy comparing to other dataset; we provided accuracy comparison between these two datasets). The reasonings can be added as a section to your future project reports such as midterm report.'
